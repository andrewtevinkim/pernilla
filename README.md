# AxFuze Pernilla

Apparently some strange men may have altered git so that you can't do something locally on a server without something like:

`error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge:
  app/views/static_pages/home.html.erb
Please, commit your changes or stash them before you can merge.`

So rather than send tracks to Crumblove I thought I'd just create something new. Take that, terrorist scum!

## Reset Mac OSX
